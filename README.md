# Circuit breaker hackathon

## Idea

Put in an arxiv link, and a bot scrapes all the emails out of the PDF/Arxiv itself. It then scrapes all of the emails off of all of the dependencies and allows the donor to reweight them based on where they appeared in the text (i.e. it defaults to something like, cited in previous work or methods splits 40% of the donation, authors cited in intro split 10% of the funds or whatever). It then deploys zk-email wallets for all of them and sends them the money.

Potentially extend the idea by creating a grants round for these researches , who can put up their proposal. There will be a pool which will distributed among there peers. Users can vote On chain privately using MACI , and then based on which the funds/donations are sent to the userâ€™s wallet
